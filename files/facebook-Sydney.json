We serve food, our own locally brewed beer with suggested food and beer matchings. ", "description": "Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, home to Australia\u2019s most awarded brewery. Enjoy Sydney\u2019s leading beer and food experience, whether it is drinking the extensive range of real craft beers, enjoying beer and food matching at its best, or simply enjoying a quick snack, meal or dessert. Redoak offers something for everyone. But best of all, you can be sure of getting great beers, great food and great service.\n\nDavid started brewing beer at the age of 14 when he created his first ginger beer. He developed a passion for brewing beer in his teens and always dreamed of brewing a range of premium beers for the Australian market.\n\nOver the years he developed his own unique methods of brewing specialty beers and has used these, along with some more traditional methods, to create the range available in the Redoak Boutique Beer Caf\u00e9. \n\nRedoak\u2019s unique beer styles\n\nRedoak\u2019s signature beer is the Framboise Froment, which is brewed in Belgian style with fresh raspberries infused resulting in intense flavours and aroma. This beer has won international fame winning a Gold medal at World Beer Cup, USA 2008 and Gold medal at International Beer Challenge, UK 2009. It took home Gold and Best in Class medals at the 2004 awards. This is a very popular beer with both men and women. \n\nAnother favourite is the Redoak Belgian Chocolate Stout, which is Australia\u2019s first fully Belgian chocolate beer made by infusing Redoak\u2019s Oatmeal Stout with the finest dark Belgian chocolate. David has also created another Australian first in the Redoak Belgian Choc-Cherry Stout, in which fresh cherries are used to create a luxurious sweet sensation.\n\nComplementing the exotic premium range is the Redoak Organic Pale Ale, which was created using some traditional English brewing methods and only certified organic grown malt and hops. Redoak is the first brewery in New South Wales to create organic beers and the first in Australia to brew organic pale ale.\n\nThe Redoak Brewery currently brews over 40 premium beers, of which 20 are available at any one time at the Redoak Boutique Beer Caf\u00e9. Redoak was the first brewery in Australia to brew more than 10 of its own beers and has subsequently extended it's range of beers considerably.\n\nAll beers are created using only the highest quality ingredients, contain no additives, preservatives or added sugars. Redoak beers are not pasteurised and are served fresh. \n\nRedoak matches premium beer with fine cuisine\n\nIn addition to premium quality beers, Janet and David offer a menu of exquisite gourmet cuisine, developed together with Head Chef Chris Beard as the perfect accompaniment to the Redoak beer range.\n\nDiners at the Redoak Boutique Beer Caf\u00e9 can choose from a selection of tempting dishes made with quality ingredients. Redoak has specially combined food and beer to create a unique experience for the customer. Janet Hollyoak said, \u201cEach dish uses carefully selected premium Australian produce and is complimented with a unique beer style to provide the diner with a unique tasting experience.\u201d\n\nRedoak has created a beer appreciation course to take customers through the brewery history, process and special qualities and characteristics that define a premium beer. Customers can then enjoy the fine cuisine complimented by a Redoak beer, while being taken through the individual flavour and aroma profiles of different beer styles.\n\nThe Caf\u00e9 also offers unique Tasting Boards \u2013 the first of their kind in Australia. The Tasting Boards each hold four canap\u00e9 style dishes that are matched with four different Redoak premium beers. The boards are designed to enable diners to experience the unique cuisine and premium beers. The tastes and flavours of the dishes and beer are enhanced as the diners palate develops when they move across the board. \n\nJanet and David have created a stylish boutique beer caf\u00e9 which is uniquely different in many ways to any other drinking or eating establishment in Sydney or across Australia. Every aspect has been put together with the upmost detail. For example, the bar tops are made from 700 year old jarrah timber sourced from West Australia\u2019s famous Fremantle Wool Store and decorated with Italian mosaic tiling.\n", "name": "Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe", "location": {"city": "Sydney", "country": "Australia", "latitude": -33.86975, "longitude": 151.20513, "state": "NSW", "street": "201 Clarence Street", "zip": "2000"}, "phone": "0292623303", "picture": {"data": {"height": 50, "is_silhouette": false, "url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p50x50/386157_355312671162232_952109667_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&_nc_oc=AQmI9aCQYz1q2364T69WnbYw7jzKpJqcyYyCijbjnbGwznYG4NMkjzyGJdh_t5dJ9uE-Eq80hLMFtXmDN1l2q_PF&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=2660e1297312cbe46c5486954b222fe3&oe=5D52AEAA", "width": 50}}, "website": "http://www.redoak.com.au/", "overall_star_rating": 4.5, "checkins": 17860}, {"id": "512222382138022", "about": "Located in the former grand ballroom of the Queen Victoria Building, The Tea Room QVB is open daily for a la carte lunch and a decadent high tea service.

Not THIS venue, but A venue. The venue was tiny, barely enough room to really understand where the patrons would sit, let alone where the booze would be, but it had potential and a vision began forming. Some time later, amidst lease negotiations and legal advise a name was chosen. The Swinging Cat. Because in that venue, there was barely enough room to swing a cat. Obviously, fate intervened and that venue was snapped up by some other ambitious entrepeneur and we were back on the hunt for a new location. Over the intervening years there were big venues and small venues, none quite ticking the boxes, but throughout the search a brand was born.\n\nThe Swinging Cat encompasses the culture, beauty and sheer magic from the legendary birth place of the Sazerac, Ramos Gin Fizz, and of course the Hurricane. New Orleans. The city itself offers such a varied and colorful history which is still seen today down every street of the French Quarter. Our vision of The Cat was not to recreate a bar in New Orleans, but rather to capture the energy and atmosphere which is so unique to New Orleans, and bottle that feeling inside our little corner of Sydney. The design elements draw from every aspect of NOLA's French Quarter, from the gas lit street lamps, to the mosaic entryways we hope to transport you straight onto the corner of Rue Royal and Conti.\n", "name": "The Swinging Cat", "location": {"city": "Sydney", "country": "Australia", "latitude": -33.868639029, "longitude": 151.205325595, "state": "NSW", "street": "44 King St", "zip": "2000"}, "phone": "0292623696", "picture": {"data": {"height": 50, "is_silhouette": false, "url": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-1/p50x50/15241894_560146190849760_1453652422714655190_n.png?_nc_cat=105&_nc_oc=AQnzqfxiYUwtmVKsOQFI31wpLQMo0UO-Hgvz-qL2x392V33xreJgfM9k2VfRETm8URxhBRi3XZAyGouYjk7-B945&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=039c93a00df9e9933c2a64821a66c691&oe=5D6EFF13", "width": 50}}, "website": "http://theswingingcat.com", "overall_star_rating": 4.7, "checkins": 4515}, {"id": "195626423845987", "about": "\"get yourself a drink, have a good time now, welcome to paradise...\" ", "description": "SILY is a local small bar, hidden between three heritage listed storehouses in the CBD. \n\nThe industrial space is brought to life by luscious plants, playful fairy lights, live music and murals by prominent street artists.

It was originally situated where the granite pylons now stand. \n\nThe new Harbour View Hotel is on land set aside around 1915 for religious purposes. The owners at the time, Brewers Tooth & Company would not move from the area and some arrangements took place between church, Brewer and State Government to obtain the site. Architect's drawings dated 1921 exist and construction would have started soon after. Local residents reveal that the main patrons in the early days were bridge construction workers and tunnellers working on the underground railway. \n\nThe current owners purchased the Harbour View hotel in 1998 and closed the hotel in July 2000 to start renovations.  This took 12 months to complete and the hotel and site is now within a National Trust conservation area listed on the State Heritage Register with a permanent conservation order. \n\nThe hotel has an elegant public bar, with its own grand piano and Bridge memorabilia, two function rooms, rooftop cocktail bar, formal a la carte restaurant and a  gaming room.

Its unique for the whole world - it is moving to Asia. Its also a travel blog and a travel business. Its also a consulting business\n\nCARA&CO CONCEPT STORE\n\n\u201cONE OF THE BEST BOUTIQUES IN THE WORLD\u201d, The Wall Street Journal about Cara&Co Moscow\n\nCara&Co cannot be labeled. It\u00b4s neither a boutique, nor a shop, nor a department store. But it combines these three elements into a concept store that contains intellectual fashion, art, high-tech, food and music in a truly inspiring environment. Everything that you see in the store is exclusive and can't be found anywhere else in Australia.\n\nHISTORY\nIn 2007 Australian Company opened the first ever concept store in Russia, in the grounds of the Centre of contemporary art \u2013 and Cara&Co completed the European circuit, by adding Moscow to the fashion lover\u00b4s itinerary. \n\nIn August 2011 the world famous Cara&Co opened its doors in Sydney \u2013 in Westfield Pitt Street Shopping Town \u2013 in the heart of Sydney\u2019s shopping mecca. \n\nCara&Co has been built on a firm philosophy of researching and buying the most cutting edge selections, which reflect the very latest directions from around the world. Everything that can be found in Cara&Co is exclusive for Australia, which makes the experience at Cara&Co so unique. \n\nPHILOSOPHY - NO LOGOS FASHION ONLY\nThe main motto behind the store is \u201cNo Logos Fashion Only\u201d. Cara&Co showcases intellectual fashion at a luxe level, producing its own aesthetic version of \u201cdiscreet luxury\u201d. We are for the people who don\u2019t need any logo in order to express their personality. In addition to the international fashion, the store offers vintage pieces, selective perfumery, high-jewelry, and a range of gadgets all of which are hand picked with a keen eye for originality and function. \n\nINTERIOR\nThe Concept store itself is like a museum where every piece of interior may be treated as an exhibit. The interior of Cara&Co is a piece of subtle, considered eclecticism. \n\nRESTAURANT\nAnd at night when it\u2019s closing time for the store, it begins to live another life \u2013 the transparent metal curtain drops down to shade partly the store content and leave only a tunnel through the length of the store, which leads to the restaurant, open from midday till midnight. Subtle, theatre lighting turns up to create an intriguing atmosphere and invite gourmands to try sophisticated Flemish cuisine.

But then you look up, to see the city skyline dancing above you. You feel safe however, because just a few more steps away, awaits the stunningly designed, contemporary bar, highlighted by the copper keg hanging from the roof - you\u2019ve reached your destination. \n\nAn otherwise smart casual bar, the space is made remarkable by the stand out green wall which creates a mesmerising tableau of lush greenery that sits perfectly against the sun coming through the open roof, or the glowing lights of the night sky.\n\nCatering for any occasion, Taylor\u2019s creates an immense atmosphere that can\u2019t be reciprocated anywhere else. Post work drinks, date nights, or star gazing city cocktails, coupled with live local and international music acts, make it the perfectly balanced venue that you will never want to leave. Relax, and enjoy the views of Sydney\u2019s eye catching landmarks, with the familiar feeling of being in your own backyard, and with a cocktail menu to die for, no matter what your taste, you\u2019ll find something from the classic Margarita to Taylor\u2019s signature spiced and sour, to make time stop for a moment whilst you regather your thoughts.\n\nLate at night, Taylor\u2019s really starts to shine. Partnerships with local record labels, and access to the best talent, from Sydney and abroad, ensures all bases are covered entertainment wise.\n\nWith the recent acquisition of the outstanding Lee Thompson to lead the Taylor\u2019s kitchen, you will leave completely satisfied. Seamlessly combining a classic pub menu, with Mediterranean and Asian influences, your taste buds will be dancing to a different beat, come the first bite.\nThompson comes to Taylors with a background most can only dream of, and one that we ourselves are in awe over. Formerly head chef at two of Sydney\u2019s finest, and longest standing establishments, Opera Bar, and the Morrison & Oyster Room, the credentials really do speak for themselves.
